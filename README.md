HELP NEEDED.
All right gang, I spent all night last night trying to get the new mali drivers on the Rott image, and in true Tinker Board style there are no directions. Tried a few directions on line, no Dice. So I come to you smart cats. I have never really messed with kernels. So i need help patching/recompiling our kernel. Is there any one out there willing to help me out?
We need these [mali driver at bottom], on the Rott 0.6.5 (or 2.0.5 debian, if this we neet to fix the wifi again) image get me a copy back, then I can rebuild everything from the ground up.
